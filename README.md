# ADHD Ontology

## Purpose
The ontology is designed to provide a formal representation of knowledge related to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), supporting healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process.
By systematically capturing the diagnostic criteria and symptomatology, the ontology seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce the risk of false positives.
This structured framework allows clinicians to assess symptoms and criteria more precisely, making it a valuable tool for ensuring that diagnoses are aligned with established standards, such as those outlined in the DSM-5.
Additionally, the ontology can facilitate better communication between professionals, offering a shared understanding of ADHD that can improve patient outcomes.

## Scope
The ontology encompasses medical and psychological knowledge related to ADHD, including formal definition of ADHD, symptoms, 
criteria-based diagnosis (DSM-5), therapeutic and pharmacological approaches and age differences in development and manifestation of symptoms.

## Implementation Languages
The ontology was implemented using OntoUML and OWL.

## Intended End-Users
___User 1.___ Health professionals (psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists).

___User 2.___ Medical and educational institutions.

___User 3.___ Researchers and academics involved in the study of ADHD.

___User 4.___ Developers of medical diagnostic support systems.

___User 5.___ Patients and family members (indirectly, through professionals who use the ontology).

## Intended Uses
